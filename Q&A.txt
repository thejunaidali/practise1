1.Manual testing:- A Human tester manually tests the software, perfoming all the actions that the real users are supposed to take.

2:- automated testing:-A software tool conduct the testing.programmatically excuting the code under the test.and verify the acutal output with the expected result.

Question 1:- what is Automtion testing?
answer:- Automation testing is a software testing strategy in which a tester programmatically runs the tests using a tool or a framework instead of manually 
going through the test cases and executing them one by one.


The primary goal of automated testing is to save time, effort, and money on repetitive tests that donâ€™t change frequently.

Automation testing helps teams and organizations automate the testing efforts, in turn reducing the need for human intervention and 
thus achieving greater speed, reliability, and efficiency. It also helps speed up the development cycle, as the developers get quick feedback and can iterate quickly
